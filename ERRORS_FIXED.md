# ✅ COMPILATION ERRORS FIXED

## 🐛 **Errors Found and Fixed:**

### 1. **Navigation Route Arguments Issues** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Several screens were passing incorrect arguments to navigation routes
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `rules_reveal_screen.dart` - Added proper gameRoom and currentUserId arguments
- Fixed `voting_screen.dart` - Corrected navigation arguments structure  
- Added missing `multiplayer_game_timer` route in main.dart with proper arguments

### 2. **GameStatsService Method Call Errors** - FIXED ✅  
**Problem**: `recordGameResult()` called with wrong parameter names
**Solution**:
- Fixed `voting_results_screen.dart` - Updated to use correct parameters:
  - `result: GameResult.win/loss` instead of `won: playerWon`
  - `role: PlayerRole.spy/detective` instead of `wasSpy: isSpy`
  - Added required `allPlayerIds` parameter

### 3. **Widget Structure Syntax Error** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Extra closing brace in `multiplayer_game_timer_screen.dart` causing build failure
**Solution**:
- Removed extra `),` on line 729 that was breaking widget structure

### 4. **Missing Room Status Cases** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: New RoomStatus enum values not handled in switch statements
**Solution**:
- Added all new status cases in `room_lobby_screen.dart`:
  - `RoomStatus.rulesRevealed`
  - `RoomStatus.voting` 
  - `RoomStatus.resultsShowing`
- Added corresponding icons, colors, and text for each status

### 5. **Service Access Issues** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: RoomService firestore instance not accessible from external screens
**Solution**:
- Added public getter `FirebaseFirestore get firestore => _firestore;` in RoomService
- Enabled external access for room data retrieval
